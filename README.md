**FPGA Explorer** is an interactive platform designed to simplify the exploration and learning of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Whether you're a student, teacher, or hobbyist, this tool helps you understand, develop, and simulate FPGA logic in a visual and intuitive way.

üëâ [**Try it online**](https://two024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-4.onrender.com/client.html)
you can use the file example.sdf to test the application.
You can also upload your own `.sdf` files to visualize and simulate them.

# Features

- **Visual Logic Simulation**  
  Simulate FPGA circuits in real time and watch how data flows through flip-flops, LUTs, and wires‚Äîperfect for exploring internal chip behavior.

- **Educational Focus**  
  Designed for learning, FPGA Explorer makes it easy to understand digital logic by visualizing how components interact, step by step.

- **Pivot Format**  
  Upload `.sdf` files and watch them automatically parsed into a structured JSON format designed for clarity and modularity.  
  You can download the generated JSON, tweak it, and re-upload it to create your own examples effortlessly.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python 3.x (for JSON Creator)

# Configuration

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-4.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory
```bash
cd 2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-4/src
```
3. Start the application
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The interface will open in your browser at http://localhost:8080/code/client.html.

# JSON Creator (Helper Tool)

FPGA Explorer includes a **command-line script** to help users generate custom `.json` files without writing them from scratch. This is ideal for testing small examples or building circuits manually.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This tool is **optional** and not the main feature of the platform.

## Run the Script

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 ./src/json_creator/json-creator.py
```

It will guide you step by step through:
- Adding **LUTs**, **Flip-Flops**, and **I/Os**
- Creating **connections** with timing delays
- Saving everything into a valid `output.json` file

You can upload the generated file directly into FPGA Explorer to simulate your custom circuit.

## Important Notes
- **Case sensitive**: Use correct casing for element types (`LUT`, `FlipFlop`, `IO`)
- **Unique IDs**: Required for LUTs and Flip-Flops
- **Valid timing**: Must be a numeric value
- **I/Os use names** instead of numeric IDs
