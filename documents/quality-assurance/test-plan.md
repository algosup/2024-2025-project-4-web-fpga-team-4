## 1. **Introduction**

- **Project Name:** Web FPGA Team 4
- **Version:** 0.1.0
- **Date:** 02/28/2025
- **Prepared By:** [Guillaume DESPAUX](https://github.com/guillaumedespaux)

This file provides all the necessary information about how/what/when does the test needs to be integrated.

## 2. **Types**

The tests will be separated into 4 main categories:

- **HTML**

  The **HTML** will be verified based on the figma design provided by the program manager Maxime Caron. Ensuring the right render depending the size of all the screen approved to be used.

- **CSS**

  The **CSS** will be verified based on the figma design provided by the program manager Maxime Caron. Ensuring the right render to be more easy to understand and clear to be used.

- **JavaScript**

  The **JavaScript** will be verified based on the technical specification provided by the technical leader Emilien Chinsy. Ensuring that the right information are passed from the parser to the `html` and `css`.

- **Parser**

  The **parser** will be verified based on the technical specification provided by the technical leader Emilien Chinsy. Ensuring that the right information coming from `.sdf` file are converted into `.json` and are usable by the javascript.

## 3. **Timeline**

## 4. 
  - Timeline when i do test
  - when i give response of tests
- how doing tests (ordered)
  - envirnoment 
  - how i repsond them
  - where i stock them
  - priorities
- what i test and what i don't test
- why does the test pass or not
  - eg. figma
- it is a real bug or not
