# Weekly Report 1

## Overview

This week marked the first steps of the project. The primary focus was on understanding the project's requirements, identifying the client's needs, initializing the project structure, and starting the design phase. This report will cover the week's objectives, the team's feedback, progress on the objectives, additional contributions, challenges encountered, and plans for the upcoming week.

## Week 1 Objectives

- Understand Project Requirements

  - Conduct a meeting with the client to gather detailed information
  - Clarify the scope, expectations, and technical specifications

- Identify Client's Needs

  - Analyze the client's vision for the project
  - Define the purpose and intended outcomes
  - Create a Project Charter to formalize understanding

- Project Initialization
  - Set up version control and branch securities
  - Initiate Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt Chart
  - Establish project management tools and frameworks

## Team Feedback

## Project Progress

- **Understanding Project Requirements**

  - On Tuesday, February 25th, a meeting was held with the client to discuss the project’s requirements and specificities.
  - The client provided context on the project's purpose: to create a web interface for an FPGA simulator to help students understand FPGA functionality.
  - The client clarified expectations regarding the project's functionalities and technical constraints.

- **Identifying Client's Needs**

  - The team held a brainstorming session after the meeting on February 28th to align on the client's vision.
  - A [Project Charter](../project-charter.md) was drafted and sent to the client to confirm the understanding of the project's needs.
  - A MoSCoW prioritization chart was created as part of the Project Charter to classify features by importance.

- **Project Initialization**

  - **Branch Securities**: Set up by Emilien Chinsy to ensure version control consistency.
  - **WBS & Gantt Chart**: Initiated by Thibaud Marlier to break down tasks and schedule the project timeline.
  - **Satisfaction Form**: Created by Thibaud Marlier to gather continuous client feedback.
  - **Weekly Report Framework**: Designed by Thibaud Marlier to maintain consistent project reporting.
  - **[Naming conventions](../../technical-specifications/naming-conventions.md)** document was created, outlining files, folders and code naming conventions.

- **First Design Prototyping**

  - **Design**: Maxime Caron and Clémentine Curel started working on the first design prototype of the web interface.
  - **Logotyping**: Clémentine Curel began creating logotypes, banners, and UI components for the web interface.

## Extras

- **Technology Stack Discussions**

  - Laurent Bouquin, Jason Grosso, and Emilien Chinsy prematurely discussed which technologies they plan on using for the project.
  - They decided to work using HTML, CSS, Typescript and NodeJS.

- **Started Working on Technical Specifications**
  - Previous discussion mentionned lead to the initilization and to the mention of technologies used in the technical specifications document.

## Challenges

- **Complex Requirements**

  - FPGA technologies are inherently complex, making it challenging to fully grasp the project requirements in the initial stages.

- **Lack of Information**

  - The team is still awaiting answers to some critical questions from the client, which are necessary for moving forward.

- **Efficient Design Process**
  - The design phase is expected to be time-consuming, requiring meticulous attention to detail and regular feedback loops.

## Next Week Plans

- **Finish First Prototype**

  - Finalize the creation of the design prototype and send it to the client for feedback.

- **Iterate Upon Client's Feedback**

  - Review and implement changes to the project charter and the prototype based on client feedback.

- **Start Working on Design Prototype Number 2**

- **Begin Work on the Functional Specifications Document**

  - Maxime Caron will start drafting the functional specifications regarding the web interface.

- **Finish KPIs Initialization**

- **Plan and Break Down Tasks**

- **Initialize Code Environment**
  - Laurent Bouquin and Jason Grosso will collaborate with Emilien Chinsy to set up the basic coding environment for the project.
