# **Weekly Report 1**  

## **Overview**  

This week marked the first steps of the project. The primary focus was on understanding the project's requirements, identifying the client’s needs, initializing the project structure, and starting the design phase. Additionally, discussions took place regarding the technology stack and technical specifications.  

## **Week 1 Objectives**  

- **Understand Project Requirements**  
  - Conduct a meeting with the client to gather detailed information.  
  - Clarify the project scope, expectations, and technical specifications.  

- **Identify Client’s Needs**  
  - Analyze the client’s vision for the project.  
  - Define the project’s purpose and intended outcomes.  
  - Draft and validate a Project Charter.  

- **Project Initialization**  
  - Set up version control and branch security.  
  - Initiate the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt Chart.  
  - Establish project management tools and frameworks.  

- **Start the Design Phase**  
  - Develop the first design prototype.  
  - Create initial UI components and logotypes.

The team reported good communication, and no major concerns were raised. However, it was noted that focus levels could be improved, as discussions sometimes became too noisy.  

More details on the satisfaction survey can be found **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EJIGbOufF86FP-Pb6Y5z0wuYymK0fEmoFKtg16JfIHg/edit?resourcekey=&gid=322050487#gid=322050487)**.  

## **Project Progress**  

- **Project Requirements & Client Meeting**  
  - A meeting was held on **Tuesday, February 25th**, to clarify project requirements.  
  - The client outlined the goal: **to develop a web interface for an FPGA simulator to help students understand FPGA functionality**.  
  - Expectations regarding project functionalities and technical constraints were discussed.  

- **Client Needs & Documentation**  
  - A brainstorming session was conducted on **February 28th** to align on the client’s vision.  
  - A **Project Charter** was drafted and sent to the client for validation.  
  - A **MoSCoW prioritization chart** was created to categorize features based on importance.  

- **Project Initialization**  
  - **Version Control & Branch Security**: Set up by **Emilien Chinsy** to ensure workflow consistency.  
  - **WBS & Gantt Chart**: Initialized by **Thibaud Marlier** to structure and schedule project tasks.  
  - **Satisfaction Form**: Created by **Thibaud Marlier** for continuous feedback.  
  - **Weekly Report Framework**: Designed by **Thibaud Marlier** to maintain reporting consistency.  
  - **Naming Conventions Document**: Established and documented **[here](../../technical-specifications/naming-conventions.md)**.  

- **Design Phase**  
  - **Prototype Development**: **Maxime Caron** and **Clémentine Curel** began working on the first UI prototype.  
  - **Logotyping & UI Components**: **Clémentine Curel** started creating logos, banners, and interface elements.  

## **Extras**  

- **Technology Stack Selection**  
  - **Laurent Bouquin, Jason Grosso, and Emilien Chinsy** discussed and selected **HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Node.js** as the project’s core technologies.  

- **Technical Specifications**  
  - Initial discussions led to the **first draft of the technical specifications document**.  

## **Challenges**  

- **Complexity of FPGA Technologies**  
  - Fully grasping the technical requirements posed initial challenges.  

- **Lack of Information**  
  - Some critical details are still missing from the client, causing minor delays.  

- **Design Process Efficiency**  
  - The iterative nature of design development requires structured feedback and refinements.  

## **Next Week Plans**  

- **Finalize the First Design Prototype**  
  - Complete and submit the initial UI prototype to the client.  

- **Iterate Based on Client Feedback**  
  - Adjust the Project Charter and prototype as needed.  

- **Begin Second Prototype Development**  

- **Start Functional Specifications Document**  
  - **Maxime Caron** will begin drafting the web interface’s functional specifications.  

- **Complete KPI Initialization**  

- **Plan & Break Down Tasks Further**  

- **Initialize the Code Environment**  
  - **Laurent Bouquin, Jason Grosso, and Emilien Chinsy** will collaborate on setting up the coding environment.
