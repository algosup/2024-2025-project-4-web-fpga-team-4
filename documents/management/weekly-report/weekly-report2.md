# **Weekly Report 2**

## **Overview**

This week was primarily focused on finalizing and submitting the first design prototype to the client, receiving feedback, and iterating on improvements. Additionally, progress was made on the functional specifications document and understanding the project's technical aspects, including the `.SDF` source file. The team also began implementing the foundational elements of the web interface.

## **Week 2 Objectives**

- Finalize the first design prototype
- Submit the prototype to the client and collect feedback
- Analyze client feedback and apply necessary improvements
- Continue working on the functional specifications document
- Gain a deeper understanding of the `.SDF` source file and its structure
- Begin implementing core elements of the web interface

The team reported good communication, though a suggestion was made to create a shared document to track discussions and avoid losing important information.

On a more negative note, a few team members were absent on Thursday after a night out, which impacted productivity. They were informed that such unprofessional behavior should not be repeated to maintain the project's progress.
