## Project Overview

### Project Introduction

This project was requested by the CNES (Centre national d'études spatiales)<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> objective of this project is to develop a web page that will help teachers explain how FPGA's (Field Programmable Gate Arrays)<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> work. It will do so by displaying an example or simulation of what is happening inside the FPGA when certain code is executed. The website will use information stored in sdf files (I don't know yet if we will convert the file to JSON for example or not so i'm leaving this here so I know I have to change it)<sup><a href="#change">[change]</a></sup>. Since the goal of this project is to help teach, we need to focus on UX and UI design as it is paramount to this project's success.

The web page will be developped using HTML and CSS as they are the basic web development programming languages and we will use TypeScript and NodeJS to help making the page more dynamic and easier to use.

### Document Purpose

The purpose of this document is to detail and explain how to create the web page by implementing the features detailed in the [functional specification (will add link when functional is done)](https://perdu.com).
The web page we are creating is a tool requested by the CNES, it will be used by teachers to help teach how FPGA's
