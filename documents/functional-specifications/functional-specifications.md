## Introduction

### Glossary


### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web interface for simulating the internal chip flows of an FPGA. This interface will enable teachers and students to easily upload SDF files, adjust real-time clock speeds, and view simulation results. By streamlining the simulation process, this tool will enhance the educational experience and provide a practical demonstration of FPGA behavior in classroom settings.

### Project Definition

#### Vision
The vision of this project is to provide an open-source educational web platform for learning FPGA internal functioning and exploring the challenges associated with this technology.

Team objectives include:
- Developing a user-friendly web interface for simulating FPGA internal chip flows.
- Providing tools for uploading SDF files, adjusting clock speeds, and controlling simulations.

  - **Details:** Environmental factors will be integrated using parameterized models and lookup tables derived from real-world measurements. This will allow the simulation to reflect subtle variations in chip performance under different conditions.  
  - **End Goal:** To achieve simulation accuracy within 5% of real-world measurements, providing a more immersive and educational experience that mirrors actual FPGA behavior.

- **Collaborative Simulation:**  
  - **Functionality:** Introduce collaborative simulation features to enable multiple users to interact with the simulation simultaneously.  
  - **Details:** The interface will support shared dashboards and real-time collaboration tools, with role-based access control to manage simultaneous interactions and prevent conflicts.  
  - **End Goal:** To support at least 5 simultaneous users without performance degradation, thereby promoting interactive learning, knowledge sharing, and teamwork among students and researchers.
